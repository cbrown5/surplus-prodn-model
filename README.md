Code from the paper, specifically the code for figure 5. Uses stan to fit a Pella-Tomlinson surplus production model to CPUE series. Then estimates the probability of overfishing, given a sudden productivity decline (ostensibly caused by coral habitat loss, as per processes described in [Brown et al. 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12318))

The stan code is optimized for computational efficiency. See notes therein. The optimization does make interpreting the model a bit more difficult, but it speeds up the MCMC chains considerably. 

**Figure 5** Probability present day catch exceeds estimated MSY reference point given different assumed % reductions in the intrinsic growth rate (r).
